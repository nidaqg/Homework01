# Refactor code to make it accessible

This project was an on-the-job ticket that called for refactoring code from an existing static website (Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc.) to make it more accessible. Acessiblility in this context refers to modifying code to help people with disabilities better navigate a given webpage by maing it readable through the use of assistive technologies.
Accessiblity is an important asspect of any technology, be it a dynamic application or a static webpage. Not only does it help people with disabilities navigate virtual space, making an application or webpage more accessible also helps businesses through better ranking by search engines. 
In this project I worked on accessiblity through a few different ways. Wherever possible, I replaced non-semantic HTML elements with semantic equivalents to allow assistive technologies to be better able to read the code. Adding image alt attributes also helped achieve this aim. In addition, I removed unnecessary closing tags, spaces or elements for a cleaner code and inserted comments to help other developers know where and why changes were made.
